## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interesteed in analysing the AirBnb Boston Dataset:

1.How much is the price depending on the location?

2.What amenities are there and how are they distributed?

3.Can we predict the price by using sklearn and tensorflow?

The main motivation was to write a program to compare the prices of different accomodations with each other and to check whether the price for this accomodation is justified, to high or to low (depending from location, size, amenities and so on)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are a notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://tino-riebe.medium.com/what-are-the-metrics-that-influence-the-airbnb-room-price-in-boston-616adb44debf).
